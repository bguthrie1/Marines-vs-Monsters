Marines vs Monsters (also called Monster Perceptions!)
New version 1.1!
And a changelog!

ChangeLog:

1.1
- Added the Zombie marines, Revenant, Demon, Spectre, Nightmare Demon (play as either the Demon or Spectre on Nightmare for the fast stats to kick in), Wolfenstein SS and the Icon of Sin.
- Tweaked some monster attacks so that they closely resemble their AI counterparts
- Removed "AI Targeting Monsters" from the class menu
- Added a new single player mode for the demons to the skill screen called Marine vs Monsters

This mod allows you to play as the Doom monsters with their abilities, speeds, weaknesses, etc. all intact. Other monsters won't attack you unless provoked. I've also made a single player mode for the demons if you want to test out some of the monsters on the marines, although I recommend you play as the "Demon Hero" class if you want to survive. I am thinking about splitting the Single player part from this mod since it took a drastic turn from my original plan (which was just to have a non functional marine and test the monsters on him).

Most of the monsters are self-explanatory. The ones that have special abilities are:

The Arch-Vile: Pressing the fire button when you are not looking at a target will heal any corpses in front of you close by (the screen will flash green indicating that you are healing). To attack, face a target and press the fire button.

Pain Elemental: In order to fire a Lost soul, you have to face an enemy. Lost souls won't spawn if there's an object/actor blocking them.

Demon Hero: Mainly built for the Marines vs Monsters mode, this demon can perform six abilities (considering the player has the Powerspheres to perform them) to destroy the marines in his path. His abilities are:

- A normal attack which fires a single fireball (same damage as a baronball but with a higher speed). Takes five health points to fire, but can absorb ten health points from an enemy upon impact.
- A spread attack which fires three fireballs. It can also absorb health on impact, more so because its three fireballs instead of one.
- A rapid fire attack, used for stunning enemies. No health is taken from you, but no health is absorbed. The weakest of the abilities.
- An extremely fast and damaging projectile that takes 20 health points per shot
- A powerful explosive attack that takes 50 health points per shot
- A shield ability that protects the user from the front for 10 seconds. After that, you cannot change or use weapons for another 10 seconds.

If there's interest in the single player aspect, I might expand on it. In the meantime, I'll be working on making a Zandronum version with actual TDM for this.

I want to credit those who made previous player monster projects, as well as Xaser for his post on health regeneration (absorbing health points from enemies).

Feel free to leave feedback, comments, etc.
